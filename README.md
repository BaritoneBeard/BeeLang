# BeeLang
Stupid (but fun) little esoteric language, will be updated frequently.

To run BeeLang
``` Python3 Bee.py ```

Currently, BeeLang is interpreted.

BeeLang is similar perhaps the most infamous esoteric language, Brainfuck. BeeLang consists of an array of registers which all start at 0, these registers can be incremented, and will display a letter based on what value is being store. 0-25 for a-z, -1 for space.

**For help:**
```bee```

**B** refers to current register. \n
**b** refers to ptr location. \n
**eE increments** \n
**Ee decrements** \n
**BEE** prints all registers \n
**Bee** prints current register \n
